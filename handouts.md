### [States in Combinatorics](https://na-cho.github.io/files/states.pdf)
This handout was created to address the need of a free and useful resource for learning the method of event states. Prior to this handout, the only thorough and useful resource was AoPS Intermediate Combinatorics, which isn't cheap and also may be too broad for a focused mathematician.
