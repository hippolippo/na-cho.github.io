### Olyver
Olyver was a project to make International Math Olympiad Shortlist problems easily accessible via a discord bot. Though I no longer work on developing Olyver, it can still be used in the [development server](). However, now I am working on a similar yet more expansive bot.

### Contest Bot
Though this is not my personal project, I am contributing to the development of [Contest Bot]().

### Blobby Comics
I (try to) regularly update my comic strip, [Blobby Comics](https://www.reddit.com/r/blobbycomics/), which stemmed from a online Health course by accident.
